## The Idea

This is an exploration of new methods to navigate the web as a way of challenging the standard link-and-scroll navigation that has always been the go-to method, even as web technologies have advanced rapidly.

Inspired by the 3D spaces offered in AR/VR technologies and the freedom to explore in non-predetermined way such as the adventure offered by many open-world games.
